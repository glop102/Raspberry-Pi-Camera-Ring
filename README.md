#3D Model Capture Rig

This project is an attempt to make a simple suite that makes having a raspberry pi based Capture Rig simple. The point is to have a number of pi's, each with a camera on a pole, capable of taking a picture simultaniously and then relay the images to a central admin station.

##Concept

There are 3 computers in the system; Admin, Camera, Projector. The Admin controls the flow of the system and is the relay point of the images that just got captured. The Camera systems wait to be told to take a picture, and then upload the images to the admin after they have done so. The Projector systems display an image on a projector overhead to add noise to the subject so that the rendering program has more useful data to reconstruct with. There is the 4th computer, the client, which simply contacts the admin via a web-browser to give commands and to download a zipfile of the images take.
